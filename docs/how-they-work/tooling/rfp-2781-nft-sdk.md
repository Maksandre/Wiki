## #2781 Request for Proposals for the NFT SDK

Polkadot.JS is the primary API tool for interacting with Polkadot parachains, including AssetHub. It provides direct access to blockchain functionality, making it essential for low-level integrations and complex dApp architectures. However, working with raw extrinsics and runtime upgrades requires deep Polkadot knowledge and significant development effort. Improving Polkadot.JS as a tool for developers to create NFT dApps is important. This work will be handled by the NFTMozaic team and others.

At the same time, we are confident that creating an SDK for NFT dApps on AssetHub is essential. This will help successfully onboard a larger number of teams and projects. It is especially important for the current state of AssetHub, where it transitions from its very limited role as a system parachain into a critical role for the PolkadotHub.

As described in the presentation of our research on Polkadot ecosystem NFT SDKs, Unique Network has an SDK with a good track record for the purposes intended here. Its goal is to make a new developerâ€™s experience with building on Polkadot very easy and fast. Apillon is doing wonders with similar goals. The critical missing piece is that neither of them covers AssetHub, nor do they support most other parachains. We would like to encourage both to propose here their vision of what it would take for them to fill in the missing AssetHub integration. We also invite other teams to submit their proposals.

Community members are encouraged to ask questions on this topic. We want to ensure that different needs are addressed and various points of view are taken into account moving forward.

We have created a high-level requirements description in the NFT SDK Specification that can serve as the base for proposal functionality. Proposers do not have to cover 100% of the listed requirements. We are only asking for justification for a particular choice. Some use cases may not need all of them but can have their own value. Proposals submitted here or to the Telegram group will be reviewed, and the best ones will receive our full support for the OpenGov grant to execute the proposal.

Requirements for the proposal are the same as for any OpenGov proposal, and as a minimum we ask for:

- Functionality description
- Costs
- Timeline
- Credibility of the proposing team/project
- Looking forward to the proposals! For any questions feel free to ask here or at our support channel at Telegram.

NFTMozaic is an alliance within the Polkadot ecosystem dedicated to advancing NFT growth, adoption, and interoperability. It connects parachains, projects, and partners to foster collaboration, drive technical innovation, and support real-world applications to position Polkadot as a leader in next-gen NFTs.
